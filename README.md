# turtlesim-task2
Turtle Animation Task
I used The Construct website.
After logging in and creating the project, we enter the following commands individually:
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim
$ros2 pkg executables turtlesim
Finally, we run the command
$ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
